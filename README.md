### Background
Wind farm (especially the offshore wind farm) is located in remote areas and difficult to maintain manually. The Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system can obtain operating status data of wind turbine remotely, thus ensuring the healthy operation of the wind farm. However, SCADA system is often affected by various factors such as sensor failure and network congestion, resulting in data loss. We hope to use the known data to estimate the missing part of the data through big data analysis, and try to recover the loss caused by the missing data.

### Race Task
We extract actual SCADA data of a certain offshore wind farm and artificially remove some of the data, including but not limited to deleting all data of a certain time period, data of a certain turbine at a certain time, some fields of a certain turbine at a certain time, etc. The applicant needs to use the remaining data to recover the deleted data, and the accuracy of the recovery shall be the final evaluation benchmark.
